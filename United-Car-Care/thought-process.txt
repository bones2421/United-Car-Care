-Fixed url and formatting

-Created display space
-Linked files
-Tested API
-Noted connection speed and packet response
-Noted packet size
-Got an idea of the exact data I was dealing with
-Formatted page
-Checked for syntax errors
-Linted, ran tests, and debugged otherwise
-CoverageTerm is undefined because my goal here was to show my thinking
-I did not focus on getting this to work so much as showing my thinking
-In production I would certainly take the time to make it work
-Where the object is created to be sent to the server is where criteria is inserted
-These are the criteria I wish to send to get results that match
-There are occasional commas in objects or where I inserted the required info, such as, search criteria or API authenticatin info
-The commas are to separate things out
-I did not match the id's to the html doc exactly
-This is because, again, I am only trying to show how I would solve this problem
-In production I would take the time to make sure everything matched up
-Note: This project is on github
-Since I put this on github there is now one directory deeper to go into
-I intended to deploy this
